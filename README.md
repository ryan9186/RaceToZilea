Game Overview
Title: Race To Zilea

Genre: Turn-based Strategy

Game Objective
In this strategy-based game, players compete to control resource-rich tiles, construct buildings, and deploy troops on a hexagonal map. The game is won by earning a certain number of victory points, which are gained through resource management, combat, and strategic expansion.

Game Map
The game takes place on a hexagonal (hex) map, with each tile being a different tile type.

Resource Tiles: These tiles start as 'desert' and can be terraformed into more hospitable environments. Different desert features correspond to available resources. 
Each resource tile contains one or two resources with a maximum of 8 Resource Points (RP) that can be split between the resources. Only one building can be placed on each resource tile.

Buildings

Home Base:
Initial building placed at the start of the game.
Provides the player with a starting 2 RP for each resource.
Allows the player to build and deploy Rovers.

Resource Camp:
Allows players to harvest resources from terraformed tiles.
Players can terraform a resource tile and build a resource camp on it.
Must be adjacent to at least one of the player's roadways or other buildings.
Only produces resources if a Rover is present on the same tile.

Barracks:
Enables the player to buy and deploy troops.
Must be placed on a terraformed resource tile.

Resources and Terraforming
Terraforming: Converts a desert tile into a hospitable environment, making it possible to build on. Terraforming is relatively inexpensive but crucial for resource production.
Resource Points (RP): Each resource tile provides RP based on the resources it contains. A resource camp can only harvest one type of resource per tile.
Resource Types:
Steel/Metal
Food
Lithium
Oxygen
At the start of each player's turn, they gain resources according to the RP of each resource camp they control.

Units

Rovers:
Can deploy and transport combat troops.
Have a set sight range (which may be upgradeable).
Can move two tiles per turn (or four tiles if on roads).

Combat Troops: Two different types
Defense Troops: Protect tiles and buildings.
Attack Troops: Engage in combat with enemy units or buildings.

A player initiates combat by moving a Rover into a tile occupied by an enemy's Rover or building.
The defending player can choose to fight or retreat.

Retreat: The defending Rover moves to an adjacent unoccupied tile.
Fight: Both players secretly select the number of troops to commit. The player with more troops wins, but all troops involved in the battle are lost.

The losing player moves their Rover back to their Home Base.
The winner gains 1 victory point.

Win Conditions
A player wins the game by gaining 11 victory points from combat battles.
